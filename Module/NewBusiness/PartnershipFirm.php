                        <h4>What is a Partnership Firm?</h4>
                        <p>A partnership firm is a popular choice among entrepreneurs due to its simplicity and
                            flexibility. It allows multiple individuals to come together and combine their resources,
                            skills, and expertise to run a business. Registering your partnership firm is the first step
                            towards formalizing your partnership and ensuring its legal recognition.</p>
                        <h4>Governing Law</h4>
                        <p>Partnership firms in India operate under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Partners form the
                            firm through a contractual agreement known as the partnership deed.</p>

                        <h4>Partnership Deed</h4>
                        <p>This legal document includes rights and duties of partners, profit sharing, capital
                            contributions, and more. Registering the deed is vital to avoid disputes and serve as legal
                            proof.</p>
