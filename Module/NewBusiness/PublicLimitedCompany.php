                        Professionals</p>

                    <p>A Public Limited Company (PLC) is an ideal business structure for large-scale operations.
                        Entrepreneurs aiming for wide-scale market presence and public investments can benefit
                        from setting up a PLC in India. A PLC allows raising capital from the general public by
                        issuing shares on stock exchanges and enjoys limited liability, just like private
                        limited companies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hiva Professionals</strong> simplifies this process by offering end-to-end
                        assistance in company registration, compliance, and post-registration services. </p>

                        <p>A Public Limited Company (PLC) is a corporate entity that enables public ownership via

                            least 7 shareholders and 3 directors. Shares of a PLC are often listed on recognized stock
                            exchanges, offering transparency and investment opportunities for the public.</p>
