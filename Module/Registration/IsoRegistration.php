                        <p>ISO registration refers to registering an organization with an external certification body to
                            obtain certification for compliance with one or more standards established by the
                            International Organization for Standardization (ISO). ISO is a non-governmental, independent
                            organization that develops international standards to promote innovation and global best
                            practices.</p>
                        <p>With Hiva Professionals, businesses can apply for ISO certification online by submitting
                            required details and documents, after which an accredited certification body conducts
                            verification and issues the ISO certificate digitally.</p>
