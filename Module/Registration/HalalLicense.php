                        <h4>What is Halal Certificate?</h4>
                        <p>Halal Certification is primarily obtained for food and food-related products and is vital in
                            Islamic countries. Derived from the Quran, the word "Halal" means "permitted" or "lawful."
                            Halal Certification ensures that food and other consumables are clean, hygienic, and safe
                            for consumption according to Islamic law (Shariah). It emphasizes cleanliness and safety,
                            reflecting the values and beliefs of Muslim consumers.</p>
                        <h4>What is Halal Certification in India?</h4>

                            consumers. This certification is important across sectors like food & beverage,
