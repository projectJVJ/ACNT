                        <p>A PAN (Permanent Account Number) card is a crucial document for anyone engaging in financial
                            transactions or running a business in India. It serves as a unique identifier for
                            individuals and entities, helping the Income Tax Department track all tax-related
                            activities. If you are planning to register your business under GST, having a valid PAN card
                            is a mandatory requirement.</p>

                        <h4>What is a PAN Card?</h4>
                        <p>The PAN card is a 10-Characters alphanumeric identifier issued by the Income Tax Department of
                            India under the supervision of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). It is required for
                            filing income tax returns, opening a bank account, and conducting various high-value
                            transactions.</p>
                        <p>For businesses, it acts as a foundation for tax compliance, helping the government track and
                            prevent tax evasion. PAN is linked to every business transaction, whether it’s related to
                            income tax, GST, or banking operations.</p>

                        <h4>Importance of PAN Card for GST Registration</h4>
                        <p>When you register under the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the GSTIN (GST Identification
                            Number) is generated based on your PAN. This means your entire GST compliance—from return
                            filings to audits—is linked with your PAN. Without a PAN, you cannot proceed with GST
                            registration, except in cases where businesses operate in the form of government departments
                            or UN bodies, which are exempt.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> PAN verifies the legal identity of a business or
                                individual applying for GST.</li>
                            <li><strong>GSTIN Generation:</strong> GSTIN is PAN-based. A single PAN can be used to get
                                multiple GST registrations in different states.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compliance and Record-keeping:</strong> It ensures all transactions are mapped
                                and helps maintain proper records for tax purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bank Integration:</strong> Most banks require a PAN card to open a current
                                account for your business, which is also necessary for GST refunds and payments.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Types of PAN Cards</h4>
                        <p>There are two main types of PAN cards relevant for GST applicants:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Individual PAN:</strong> For sole proprietors or freelancers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Business PAN:</strong> For companies, LLPs, partnerships, and trusts. These are
                                issued in the business’s name.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Each type of PAN is linked to specific compliance requirements. For GST, it’s important to
                            ensure the PAN is valid and active in the Income Tax database.</p>
