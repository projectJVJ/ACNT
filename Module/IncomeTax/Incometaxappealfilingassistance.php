                        <h4>Understanding Income Tax Appeals</h4>
                        <p>Filing an income tax appeal is a legal recourse for taxpayers who believe that an order
                            passed by the assessing officer is incorrect or unjust. It ensures your rights are upheld
                            and offers a structured process to challenge tax assessments, penalties, interest charges,
                            or other tax decisions.</p>
