                        help with Form 15CA and 15CB filing.</p>

                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>When an Indian resident makes a payment to a non-resident or overseas company, compliance
                            with the Income Tax Act, 1961 is essential. Forms 15CA and 15CB are required to ensure taxes
                            are deducted appropriately and reported before any funds are transferred internationally.
                            Proper filing helps avoid penalties and legal hurdles.</p>

                        <h4>Legal Foundation – Section 195 of the Income Tax Act</h4>
                        <p>Section 195 mandates TDS on payments made to non-residents, where the payment is taxable in
                            India. The remitter must also report such remittances by submitting:</p>
