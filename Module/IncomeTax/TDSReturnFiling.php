                    <h4>About </h4>
                    <p>Filing your Income Tax Return (ITR) is essential for every taxpayer in India. It involves
                        detailing your income, applicable deductions, and taxes to be paid. Filing early helps you
                        avoid last-minute rush and ensures accuracy.</p>
                    <p>Hiva Professionals streamlines the ITR e-filing process with step-by-step guidance, automatic data
                        imports, and expert support. Whether you are an employee, freelancer, or entrepreneur, our
                        platform ensures hassle-free tax filing.</p>

                    <h4>TDS Return Filing Made Easy</h4>
                    <p>Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is a key compliance requirement under the Income
                        Tax Act. If you are required to deduct TDS, it’s mandatory to file quarterly returns. With
                        our guidance, you can streamline the entire TDS return filing process, stay compliant, and
                        avoid penalties.</p>

                    <h4>Understanding TDS</h2>
                        <p>TDS involves tax collection at the time of making specified payments such as salary,
                            interest, commission, rent, or professional fees. The payer (deductor) deducts a portion
                            of
                            the payment and remits it to the government on behalf of the payee (deductee).</p>

                        <h4>Who is Required to Deduct TDS?</h2>
                            <p>TDS must be deducted by individuals, firms, HUFs, companies, and other entities
                                meeting
                                specific turnover thresholds or falling under statutory requirements. TAN
                                registration is a
                                prerequisite.</p>

                            <h4>Due Dates for TDS Deposit</h2>
                                <p>TDS deducted must be deposited by the 7th of the following month. For TDS
                                    deducted in March,
                                    it should be deposited by April 30 in most cases.</p>
