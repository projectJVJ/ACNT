                    <p>
                        <strong>Private Equity (PE)</strong> refers to investments made directly into private companies or buyouts of public companies that result in their delisting from stock exchanges. These investments are typically made by private equity firms, venture capital firms, or angel investors, with the goal of enhancing the company's value over time and eventually earning a return through a profitable exit strategy such as an IPO, merger, or acquisition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Private equity plays a crucial role in corporate growth and economic development by providing long-term capital to companies that are not listed on public exchanges. These firms help businesses expand, improve operations, restructure, or enter new markets.
                    </p>
