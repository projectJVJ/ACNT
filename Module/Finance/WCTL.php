                    <p>
                        <strong>Working Capital Term Loan (WCTL)</strong> is a financial solution offered by banks and financial institutions to help businesses meet their working capital needs when there is a shortfall that cannot be covered by standard credit limits or facilities. It is particularly useful for companies experiencing seasonal cash flow issues, expanding operations, or facing delays in receivables.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        WCTL is often provided as a one-time loan repayable over a fixed period, usually in monthly or quarterly installments. Unlike cash credit or overdraft facilities, which are revolving in nature, WCTL is structured like a term loan with a fixed tenure and EMI structure.
