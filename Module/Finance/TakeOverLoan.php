                        <p>
                            The <strong>Takeover of an Existing Loan</strong> refers to the process of transferring your current loan (home loan, business loan, or personal loan) from one financial institution to another, typically to benefit from better interest rates, improved terms, or enhanced services. It is a strategic financial decision aimed at reducing the overall cost of borrowing and improving cash flow management.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In today’s competitive financial landscape, banks and NBFCs frequently offer attractive loan takeover schemes. If you're burdened with high-interest debt or inflexible repayment terms, a loan takeover can significantly ease your financial stress.
