                            <p>
                                <strong>Re-finance</strong>, or refinancing, refers to the process of revising the terms of an existing credit agreement, typically a loan or mortgage. The goal is to secure better interest rates, reduce monthly payments, or adjust the loan tenure. Refinancing is a powerful financial strategy used by individuals and businesses to improve cash flow, lower costs, and achieve long-term financial stability.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In today’s dynamic financial landscape, refinancing has become an essential tool for financial management. Whether you're handling personal debt or managing business liabilities, strategic refinancing can offer major benefits.
