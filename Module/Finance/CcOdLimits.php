                        <p>
                            In business finance, <strong>Cash Credit (CC)</strong> and <strong>Overdraft (OD)</strong> facilities are short-term borrowing tools offered by financial institutions to help businesses manage working capital needs. These are revolving credit lines that offer flexibility in borrowing and repayment, helping businesses tackle liquidity challenges effectively.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Both facilities are essential for maintaining smooth operations, especially during periods of fluctuating cash flow. While they function similarly, they differ in terms of usage, security, and purpose. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective financial planning and debt management.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="my-3">Key Features of CC/OD Limits</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Revolving Credit:</strong> Businesses can borrow, repay, and borrow again within the sanctioned limit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interest on Utilized Amount:</strong> Interest is charged only on the amount actually used, not the full sanctioned limit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Short-Term Use:</strong> Ideal for managing day-to-day operational expenses, not long-term investments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Often backed by collateral such as inventory, receivables, or fixed assets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flexible Repayment:</strong> Businesses can repay the amount anytime during the loan period.</li>
                        </ul>
