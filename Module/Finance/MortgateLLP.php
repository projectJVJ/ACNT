                    <p>
                        In the world of finance, both <strong>Mortgage</strong> and <strong>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong> play crucial roles for individuals and businesses. Understanding their structure, usage, and benefits is essential for making informed financial decisions, especially when dealing with property investments or business formation.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">What is a Mortgage?</h4>
                    <p>
                        A mortgage is a type of secured loan where real estate or property is used as collateral. It is commonly used by individuals or businesses to purchase property without paying the full amount upfront. Mortgages are paid back in installments over a specified term, typically 10 to 30 years.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Loan Purpose:</strong> Primarily used to finance the purchase of residential or commercial property.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repayment:</strong> Monthly EMIs comprising both principal and interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> The property being purchased serves as security.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tenure:</strong> Long-term loans, usually between 10 to 30 years.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Can be fixed or floating, depending on the lender.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">What is an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership)?</h4>
                    <p>
                        An LLP is a legal business structure that combines the flexibility of a partnership with the benefits of limited liability. It is ideal for professional services, startups, or small businesses that want limited legal exposure and shared responsibilities among partners.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Legal Structure:</strong> Separate legal entity governed by the LLP Act, 2008 (India).</li>
                        <li><strong>Liability:</strong> Liability of partners is limited to their capital contribution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> LLPs are taxed as a partnership firm and avoid dividend distribution tax.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Fewer regulatory requirements compared to private limited companies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Managed by designated partners with mutual agreement on roles.</li>
                    </ul>
