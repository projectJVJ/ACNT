                        <h4>What is Loan Against Property (LAP)?</h4>
                        <p>Loan Against Property is a secured loan where you pledge your residential, commercial, or industrial property as collateral. It allows you to raise funds for business expansion, education, weddings, medical expenses, or even debt consolidation while retaining ownership of your property.</p>
