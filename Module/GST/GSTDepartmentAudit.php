                    <p>A <strong>GST Department Audit</strong> is a detailed examination conducted by tax authorities to verify the accuracy of GST returns filed by businesses. This process ensures compliance with tax laws, detects discrepancies, and prevents tax evasion. Understanding the audit process is vital for businesses to avoid penalties and maintain smooth operations.</p>

                    <h4>What is a GST Department Audit?</h4>
                    <p>The GST audit is an official review of a company’s financial records, returns, and supporting documentation by GST officers. It ensures that tax obligations are met, proper credits are claimed, and taxes are paid correctly. The audit may be triggered based on turnover thresholds, risk parameters, or suspicious activities noted by the department.</p>
