                    <p>GSTR-10 is a crucial return required to be filed by businesses whose GST registration has been cancelled or surrendered. It serves as the final return and informs tax authorities about the closure or cancellation of GST registration. Filing this return ensures that the taxpayer complies with the law and clears any outstanding obligations.</p>

                    <h4>What is GSTR-10?</h4>
                    <p>GSTR-10 is known as the <strong>Final Return</strong> and must be filed by businesses whose GST registration has been cancelled. The form must be filed within <strong>three months (90 days)</strong> from the date of cancellation or surrender of GST registration. It is an important document for the business to confirm the cessation of its GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) and to ensure that there are no outstanding tax liabilities.</p>

                    <h4>Eligibility for Filing GSTR-10</h4>
                    <p>The following categories of taxpayers are required to file GSTR-10:</p>

                            <li><strong>Businesses with Canceled GST Registration</strong>: Taxpayers whose GST registration has been canceled by the GST authorities must file GSTR-10.</li>
                            <li><strong>Voluntarily Canceled Registration</strong>: Even if a taxpayer voluntarily cancels their GST registration, they are still required to file GSTR-10 to officially close the registration and declare any final liabilities.</li>
