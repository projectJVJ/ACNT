                    <p>GST Notices are formal communications issued by tax authorities under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. These notices are typically sent to highlight discrepancies in returns, seek clarifications, demand payments, or initiate proceedings in case of non-compliance. It is essential for taxpayers to address such notices promptly and accurately to avoid penalties, interest, or legal consequences.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the nature of these notices, their implications, and the appropriate course of action is vital for ensuring seamless GST compliance.</p>

                    <h4>What is a GST Notice?</h4>
                    <p>A <strong>GST notice</strong> is an official intimation from the GST Department, which may pertain to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detected irregularities in tax returns</li>
                        <li>Mismatches in input tax credits</li>
                        <li>Late or non-filing of returns</li>
                        <li>Excessive refund claims</li>
                        <li>Non-registration under GST when required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Notices may vary depending on the nature of non-compliance and can take the form of a request for clarification, show cause notice (SCN), audit notice, or demand notice.</p>

                    <h4>Common Types of GST Notices</h4>
                    <p>Here are some frequently issued notices under the GST framework:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Show Cause Notice (SCN):</strong> Issued when authorities suspect a breach of GST provisions, requiring justification from the taxpayer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Demand Notice:</strong> Communicates outstanding tax dues along with applicable interest and penalties.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scrutiny Notice:</strong> Issued for examining discrepancies in returns or documents submitted by the taxpayer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assessment Notice:</strong> Sent after the department finalizes tax liability based on available data.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Valid Methods of Service</h4>
                    <p>Under Section 169 of the CGST Act, the following are the accepted modes for serving GST notices:</p>
