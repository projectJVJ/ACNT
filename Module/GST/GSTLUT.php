                    <p>Are you an exporter looking to simplify your operations and ensure tax-free exports? The <strong>Letter of Undertaking (LUT)</strong> in the GST framework is a key document that enables exporters to engage in the export of goods and services without paying Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) at the time of supply. This guide explains the benefits and steps involved in the filing process.</p>

                    <h4>What is LUT in GST?</h4>
                    <p>The <strong>Letter of Undertaking (LUT)</strong> serves as an essential tool for exporters under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. It allows exporters to carry out their business transactions without having to pay the IGST at the time of export, helping to streamline export processes and improve cash flow.</p>

                    <h4>GST LUT Form for Exporters</h4>
                    <p>To avoid paying IGST on export transactions, exporters must file the <strong>GST LUT Form (RFD-11)</strong>, which is available on the GST portal. This form is required for exporting goods or services without the immediate need to pay taxes.</p>

                    <h4>Understanding the LUT Bond</h4>
                    <p>An <strong>LUT</strong> is valid for one financial year. For subsequent years, exporters must submit a new <strong>LUT</strong>. If the terms of the <strong>LUT</strong> are violated, a bond may be required to continue tax-free exports. The bond is applicable in the following cases:</p>
