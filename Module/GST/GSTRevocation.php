                    <p>Revocation of GST registration is a legal process through which businesses can request the reactivation of their cancelled GSTIN. Whether cancelled due to compliance failures or administrative decisions by tax authorities, this process allows eligible businesses to resume operations lawfully under GST.</p>

                    <h4>Who is Eligible to Apply for GST Revocation?</h4>
                    <p>Only taxpayers whose GST registration was cancelled by the GST officer can apply for revocation. If the registration was voluntarily cancelled by the taxpayer, a fresh GST registration is required.</p>

                    <h4>Typical Reasons Behind GST Cancellation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Failure to file GST returns for a prolonged period</li>
                        <li>Ceased business activities or business closure</li>
                        <li>Transfer of business due to sale, merger, or amalgamation</li>
                        <li>Non-compliance with GST laws and rules</li>
                        <li>Fraudulent activity or misuse of input tax credit</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Step-by-Step Guide to Apply for GST Revocation</h4>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Legal Framework: Rule 23 of CGST Rules</h4>
                    <p>Under Rule 23, a revocation application must be submitted within 90 days from the date of cancellation. Upon satisfaction, the officer issues a revocation order in Form REG-22 within 30 days of application receipt.</p>

                    <h4>Consequences of Not Filing for Revocation</h4>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid During GST Revocation</h4>

                        <li>Submitting incomplete or incorrect documentation</li>
                        <li>Failing to clear outstanding dues or file pending returns</li>
                        <li>Missing the 90-day deadline without applying for an extension</li>
                        <li>Not providing a valid and justifiable reason for revocation</li>
                        <li>Skipping professional guidance when unsure of process</li>
                    </ul>
